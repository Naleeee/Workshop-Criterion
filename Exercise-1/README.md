- You find a 10 dollars bill in the street, check your pocket to make sure **you have** 14 dollars now.

- Hopefully, you remember that your grandma gave you a 50 dollars bill for your birthday! But you must still have money to buy a 1 dollar bread for dinner tonight. Check if your current money **is more important** than the game's cost and a bread.

- You run straight to your favorite shop to buy this awesome new game! Everything goes well but you still need to buy a bread for tonight. Check if now you have **at least** enough to buy a bread.

Now that you have a fresh bread and a new video game, you can go back home to try it out!
