Let's consider you are on holidays with some friends.

You decide to go to the cinema. But you must agree on the movie before.

Everyone is represented by a `struct person` defined in the [header file](./include/exercise2.h).

    - Action

- Then you check the movies and **verify** on your phone the current list.

<br/>

- The choice of the movie is almost done! You must choose between "Star Wors, again another return of the jaydi" or "Whiploush, the drum smasher". **Collect the final choice** between everyone.

- One friend decide to buy pop-corn he ask you to choose between salty and sweet. **Give him your answer** and verify that he didn't bought salty pop-corn.
