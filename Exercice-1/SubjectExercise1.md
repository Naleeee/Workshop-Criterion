# Exercise 1

This exercise is here to let you use the basic assertions of Criterion by using only integers.

## The story

#### In The file `./tests/testAdditions.c` make tests about this story by using functions in `src/additions.c`.

Let's consider you have 4 dollars in your pocket.

- You find a 10 dollars bill in the street, check your pocket to make sure **you have** 14 dollars now.

- Then you check your phone, they just released your most wanted video game! It cost *only* 60 euros. Check test if **you can** buy it rignt now. 

- Hopefully, you remember that your grandma gave you a 50 dollars bill for your birthday! But you must still have money to buy a 1 dollar bread for dinner tonight. Check if your current money **is more important** than the game's cost and a bread.

- You run straight to your favorite shop to buy this awesome new game! Everything goes well but you still need to buy a bread for tonight. Check if now you have **at least** enough to buy a bread.

Now that you have a fresh bread and a new video game, you can go back home to try it out !
